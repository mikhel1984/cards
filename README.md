# Cards

**Cards** is a collection of programs for learning foreign words. The top line contains the question, the bottom line contains the answer. 
To see the answer or the next question, press the space key. Words are extracted from the database randomly. 
In the status bar of the window, you can see the name of the map, the time counter, and the size of the database.

The word database is a plain text file with the extension _.card_, so it can be edited in any text editor. 
Questions and answers are separated by a "--" sign.

You can have several cards with different themes. To create a new one, just add an empty file with the extension _.card_.
All cards can be opened using the corresponding button. 

Commands and aliases:
* 'Next' - whitespace
* 'New' - Ctrl+N
* 'Delete' - delete
* 'Open' - Ctrl+O
* Ctrl+R - swaps the answers and questions
* Ctrl+Q - quit

The **dict** program allows to make dictionary from the cards.
